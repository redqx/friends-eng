## [Scene 01]  

 Central Perk, everyone's there.

Monica: What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it. 

Joey: Yeah, right!.......Y'serious? 

Phoebe: Oh, yeah! 

Rachel: Everything you need to know is in that first kiss. 

Monica: Absolutely. 

Chandler: Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out. 

Ross: Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket. 

Chandler: The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake. 

Rachel: Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that **album** alone.
